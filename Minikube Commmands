Advanced Minikube Features (2)
Most minikube commands, such as start, stop, node, etc. are profile aware, meaning that the user is required to explicitly specify the target cluster of the command, through its profile name. The default minikube cluster, however, can be managed implicitly without specifying its profile name. Stopping and re-starting the two clusters listed above, the minibox cluster (explicitly) and the default minikube cluster (implicitly):

$ minikube stop -p minibox

$ minikube start -p minibox

$ minikube stop

$ minikube start

Additional helpful minikube commands:

To display the version of the current Minikube installation:

$ minikube version

minikube version: v1.32.0
commit: 8220a6eb95f0a4d75f7f2d7b14cef975f050512d

Completion is a helpful post installation configuration to enable the minikube command to respond to typical auto-completion mechanisms, such as completing a command in the terminal by pressing the TAB key. To enable completion for the bash shell on Ubuntu:

$ sudo apt install bash-completion

$ source /etc/bash_completion

$ source <(minikube completion bash)

If needed, also run the following command:

$ minikube completion bash

A command that allows users to list the nodes of a cluster, add new control plane or worker nodes, delete existing cluster nodes, start or stop individual nodes of a cluster:

$ minikube node list

minikube 192.168.59.100

$ minikube node list -p minibox

minibox   192.168.59.101
minibox-m02   192.168.59.102
minibox-m03   192.168.59.103

To display the cluster control plane node's IP address, or another node's IP with the --node or -n flags:

$ minikube ip

192.168.59.100

$ minikube -p minibox ip

192.168.59.101

$ minikube -p minibox ip -n minibox-m02

192.168.59.102

When a cluster configuration is no longer of use, the cluster's profile can be deleted. It is also a profile aware command - it deletes the default minikube cluster if no profile is specified, or a custom cluster if its profile is specified:

$ minikube delete

ðŸ”¥  Deleting "minikube" in virtualbox ...
ðŸ’€  Removed all traces of the "minikube" cluster.

$ minikube delete -p minibox

ðŸ”¥  Deleting "minibox" in virtualbox ...
ðŸ”¥  Deleting "minibox-m02" in virtualbox ...
ðŸ”¥  Deleting "minibox-m03" in virtualbox ...
ðŸ’€  Removed all traces of the "minibox" cluster.
